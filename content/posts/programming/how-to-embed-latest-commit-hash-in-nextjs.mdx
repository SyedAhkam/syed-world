Good morning frens.

Starting a series of posts based on the development of this site -- exactly where you're reading this. I've employed several new concepts into the site which I found cool.

It blows my mind seeing the post workflow working smoothly even. As I write MDX in my current favorite editor ([doom emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs)), the text and the metadata is processed on each save directly into a json file using [velite](https://velite.js.org/) which is then transformed by Next.js at build time into raw HTML :fire:;

## Retrieving the hash

Now coming to the topic at hand. Let's explore a few ways of retrieving the hash.

### 1. Call the `git` binary at build time

If you aren't aware, there's this great git command which returns the `SHA` hash of the latest commit:

```sh
$ git rev-parse HEAD
```

__TIP__: Add `--short` to retrieve the 7 char long shortened version of the hash.

__LIMITATIONS__: 1) You need to open a sub-shell. 2) Have to make sure the shell is opened in the same directory as the `.git` folder. 3) have to have `.git` as well, which you might not in cloud build environments like vercel.

### 2. Ask Github (or Gitlab or equivalent) to share the latest remote commit info with us

Assuming you use Github as your remote code storage / sharing platform, you could call their REST API or their GraphQL API to retrieve information about your repository.

For example, their REST API exposes an endpoint named:

```sh
GET /repos/:owner/:repo/commits
```

Docs available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/commits?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-commits). NOTE: Auth is necessary for private repositories.

This endpoint returns a list of `Commit` objects. Although what we're really interested is the object at index `0` (assuming commits are sorted by commit time) since that is the most recent commit.

```ts
const resp = await fetch(...);

const latestCommit = (await resp.json())[0];
```

Now a commit object somewhat looks like this:

```json
  {
    "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/commits/6dcb09b5b57875f334f61aebed695e2e4193db5e",
    "sha": "6dcb09b5b57875f334f61aebed695e2e4193db5e",
    "node_id": "MDY6Q29tbWl0NmRjYjA5YjViNTc4NzVmMzM0ZjYxYWViZWQ2OTVlMmU0MTkzZGI1ZQ==",
    ...
  }
```

We can now simply pluck out the `sha` field and we're done;

**BUT WAIT**, This is quite a common thing to do, thus github has provided a shorthand for the above.

If you provide a specific master branch name just after `/commits` and a specific `Accept` header value of `"application/vnd.github.VERSION.sha"` such that:

```sh
curl -s -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.VERSION.sha" "https://api.github.com/repos/{replace}/{replace}/commits/master"
```

All this would return is a simple text response of the 40 char long SHA hash. No need to deserialize as JSON either.

```sha
d92dbdc4edd783abea8fadce6c2f1f7c1c493140
```

__LIMITATIONS__: 1) You need to have the code in a remote repo in the first place 2) Local un-pushed commits aren't taken into consideration. 3) You have to do an API call ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Embed inside a Next.js react component

### 1. Use `getStaticProps` [only pages router]

[getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) is a magic function that you could export from your route file which instructs Next.js to execute this code at build time and treat the outcome as static data throughout from there.

```jsx
export function getStaticProps() {
  return {
    props: {
      latestCommitHash: retrieveHash() // depends on the method of your choice
    }
  }
}

export default function Page({ latestCommitHash }) {
  return <>{latestCommitHash}</>
}
```

### 2. Just directly retrieve inside your component! [RSC or App component only]

```jsx
export default function Page() {
  const latestCommitHash = retrieveHash(); // your choice

  return <>{latestCommitHash}</>
}
```

React Server Components are smart enough to cache out the call to `retrieveHash` in a way that it is either executed just at build time or very infrequently on the server.

Read Data Fetching docs [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating).

If you're still skeptical, you can add a cache policy on the fetch calls as an extra measure.

```js
const resp = await fetch(..., {
  cache: "force-cache"
})
```

### 3. Use ENV variables at build time

This might just be the simplest way: Modify your start script to include something like this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "COMMIT_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD) next dev"
  }
}
```

And then proceed to use inside your components:

```jsx
export default function Page() {
  const latestCommitHash = process.env.COMMIT_HASH:

  return <>{latestCommitHash}</>
}
```

## Tips

- To get short hash from a long one, just slice into the first 7 characters:
  ```ts
  hash.slice(0, 7)
  ```
And that's the end of the post. Thanks for reading!
